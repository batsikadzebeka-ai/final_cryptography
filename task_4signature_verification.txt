Signature Verification Explanation

The file "signed_message.asc" was decrypted and verified with GPG.

Verification results recorded in "gpg_verify_output.txt" include a line:
  "gpg: Good signature from 'Alice <alice@example.com>'"

This proves:
1. The message has NOT been modified after Alice signed it. (Integrity)
2. The signature was created using Alice's private key. (Authenticity)
3. Therefore, Bob can trust that the email was written by Alice and not tampered with.

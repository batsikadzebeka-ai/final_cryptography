TLS Communication Inspection – GitHub (https://github.com)

1. Target Website
I inspected the TLS connection to: https://github.com
Tools used:
- openssl s_client
- Wireshark

2. OpenSSL Inspection
Using:
    openssl s_client -connect github.com:443 -servername github.com -showcerts

From the output I extracted:
- TLS version: TLS 1.3
- Cipher suite: TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
- Certificate chain:
  * Leaf certificate: CN=github.com
  * Intermediate CA: (GitHub’s intermediate CA shown in the chain)
  * Root CA: A trusted public root CA in the system trust store

3. Wireshark TLS Handshake Analysis

a) Client Hello
- The Client Hello message proposes supported TLS versions (including TLS 1.3)
- Lists multiple cipher suites including AES-GCM based ones
- Includes extensions such as:
  * Server Name Indication (SNI) with “github.com”
  * Supported Groups (for ECDHE)
  * Signature Algorithms

b) Server Certificate
- The server responds with a certificate chain proving the identity of github.com
- The leaf certificate’s CN/SAN includes “github.com”
- The certificate is signed by an intermediate CA, which is in turn signed by a trusted root CA
- The browser/OS validates this chain against its trust store

c) Key Exchange
- TLS uses an ephemeral Diffie–Hellman (ECDHE) key exchange
- In TLS 1.3 this appears in the Key Share extension
- This provides forward secrecy: even if the server’s private key is compromised later, past sessions cannot be decrypted

4. How TLS Provides Confidentiality and Integrity

Confidentiality:
- After the handshake, a shared session key is established between client and server using the ECDHE key exchange.
- The application data is encrypted using an AEAD cipher (here: AES-256-GCM), so an attacker who observes the traffic cannot read the plaintext.

Integrity:
- AEAD ciphers like AES-GCM include an authentication tag (MAC) that detects any modification.
- If a packet is altered in transit, the integrity check fails and the data is rejected.

Authentication:
- The server proves its identity with its X.509 certificate issued by a trusted CA.
- The client verifies the certificate chain and hostname (github.com).
- This prevents man-in-the-middle attacks where an attacker tries to impersonate GitHub.

5. Summary
Using openssl s_client and Wireshark, I inspected a real TLS handshake to https://github.com.
I identified the TLS version, cipher suite, certificate chain, and main handshake messages
(Client Hello, Server Certificate, Key Exchange), and explained how TLS ensures
confidentiality, integrity, and authentication for HTTPS connections.
